*********************************************************************************************
*                 HOW TO USE OPTION X - TURNING OFF DELAYS IN THE INTERFACE                 *
*********************************************************************************************

           *** THIS FEATURE DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE TYPE 1 SIMULATOR DOCUMENTATION ***

By default, a Type 1 interface stores and applies the strike delay (from BDC to strike point)
in the interface, receiving the delays from Abel at startup and saving them to EEPROM. CLI
option X turns this off, so that signals are sent to the PC at BDC, not at the strike point,
which is the Type 2 behaviour. To support this, the WAIT_TO_SEND state does double duty
as the post-signal guard timer. 

When application of delays in the interface is turned off, the option to set default timers
(Option Z in Debug Mode) is changed to set to 100ms, the default Type 2 Guard Timer, instead
of 500ms, and saving to EEPROM (Option S) is changed to save the delay timers to EEPROM along
with the other settings. The serial receiver code is also changed to not overwrite the timers
when application of delays is turned off.

To disable application of delay timers in the interface, do the following:
 * Select CLI Option X to toggle the applyDelayTimers flag to FALSE.
 * Select CLI Option D to enable debugging.
 * Select CLI Option Z to set 100ms (10cs) timers.
 * Select CLI Option S to save all this to EEPROM.
 * Reboot the interface with the reset button.
 * Change the Abel configuration to check the box "Abel applies delays (No MBI)".
 
Strike delays will now be applied by Abel, and any delay values sent to the interface will be ignored.

To re-enable application of delay timers in the interface, do the following:
 * Select CLI Option X to toggle the applyDelayTimers flag to TRUE.
 * Select CLI Option S to save this change to EEPROM.
 * Reboot the interface with the reset button.
 * Change the Abel configuration to uncheck the "Abel applies delays (No MBI)" box, and restart Abel.

Abel will now send delay values to the interface, which will store and apply them.

We have to handle command input from the simulator software via the serial interface.
We also have to handle the non-MBI CLI for the prototype Arduino interface.

The MBI protocol defines two distinct commands, plus the timers:
0xFD = Are you there?, correct response is 0xFD
0xFE = Send timer values, correct response is to send 12 bytes of timer values terminated 
		with 0xFF
0xNN = Anything else is the first of 12 bytes of hex timer values, terminated with 0xFF

The implementation by Abel 3.7.0c and Beltower 12.15 appears to be as follows:
0xFD - Not used by either application.
0xFE - Not used by Abel. 
		Beltower retrieves the timer values when the sensor dialogue is opened, or when
		the "Refresh from Box" button is clicked. Sometimes two 0xFEs are issued in
		quick succession after submitting timers in Beltower 2013.
0xNN - Abel sends the delay values on program start, and then when a value is changed.
		It does not appear to use the 0xFE command to retrieve the values for checking.
		Beltower does not send the values on startup, because the interface should store
		them. The values are only sent when the sensors dialogue is closed. They are then
		retrieved (0xFE) again (sometimes twice in succession) and checked against the values
		sent. What happens if the first byte of delay data is 0xFD or 0xFE is not specified.
		
If debugging is enabled when an MBI command is received, debugging is then turned off. If an
MBI command has been received, then most likely the simulator software has been started, and
if debug is enabled, then each bell signal generates debug output which causes a fire-up
in the simulator.
